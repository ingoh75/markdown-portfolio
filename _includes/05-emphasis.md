_I am a mother, I loving taking care of my **two children: a boy and a girl.** In addition to surfing the internet, **I like to know how things work.** So, I am studying programming codes. Organize everything I do (everything, from my studies to my children's lives). **Focus is important**, as it helps ne to have **concrete goals;** Prior knowledge about different subjects helps me to know new words and to have new thoughts about life. I like video games because it is a great hobby._
